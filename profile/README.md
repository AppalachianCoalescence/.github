## NEWS
- The LISA Science Gaps have been released and are available [here](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=1038005/solicitationId=%7B05108FA8-5F27-3547-BBAF-0284D97BA62F%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/2024%20LPS%20Science%20Gaps.pdf).

- As a reminder our next face2face will be at Vanderbilt on March 24th. We will share submitted proposals, break into groups to figure next steps and/or start working on them.

## About

This is a space to gather all LISA related projects pertaining to NASA Marshall and nearby universities.

The main reason for creating this is to have a platform for all possible ideas and thus foresee possible contributions. 

It should help students figure projects they could be interested in, based both on their expertise and own timeframes.

As a centralized table of all LISA-related efforts, this could be useful for future grant writting.

**If you have a current project or are working on an idea, write it down! If you want to help with an idea, mark yourself as interested!**

We have a slack here (expires 1/10/25): https://join.slack.com/t/acme-gws/shared_invite/zt-2w2yiclpg-V~UQXneIke3eRCDQSbe0dA


## Contribution Guidelines:

A project, when pertinent, is encouraged to include:
- A person of contact that can provide/is providing advice or supervision for the project.
- An estimated level of expertise desired for the person taking on the project. I.e.: novice, intermediate, expert.
- An estimated overall timeframe for that expertise.
- An rough idea of the steps needed and timelines for each step, assuming that expertise.
